## Management and Governance on AWS

AWS offers a variety of management and governance services to help users provision, manage, govern, and operate their cloud environments more effectively. Services like AWS Organizations, AWS Config, AWS Service Catalog, and AWS Systems Manager enforce operational standards and comply with corporate IT policies.

- **AWS Organizations** enables central governance across your AWS Accounts

and resources.

- **AWS Service Catalog** allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services approved for use on AWS, including everything from virtual machine images, servers, software, and databases to complete multi-tier application architectures.

- **AWS Systems Manager** offers a unified interface for viewing and controlling both AWS and on-premises infrastructure. It includes capabilities for system patching, session management, state management, patch management, automation, maintenance windows, command execution, parameter management, and much more.

- **AWS Config** automates compliance assessment against internal policies and regulatory standards by providing visibility into the configuration of AWS and third-party resources.

**AWS Inspector** is an automated security assessment service that helps identify security issues and enforce standards in your AWS environment. You can install the AWS Inspector agent using Systems Manager and run security vulnerability assessments on your EC2 instances.

**Amazon GuardDuty** enhances the security of your AWS architecture with intelligent threat detection by monitoring AWS accounts. It analyzes data collected from AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to detect threats like intra-VPC port scanning, cryptocurrency mining, malware, and more.

**Amazon Macie** aids in compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR by detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in your Amazon S3 buckets.

**AWS Trusted Advisor** provides best practice recommendations for your AWS infrastructure, including cost optimization, security, fault tolerance, service limits, and performance.

### Best Practices for AWS CodeBuild

- Utilize a buildspec file for defining build commands and settings.
- Avoid using passwords; instead, use IAM policies and roles for permissions.
- Store secrets in AWS SSM Parameter Store or AWS Secrets Manager rather than hardcoding them.
- Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM), not SSH, for secure command execution.

### Best Practices for AWS CodeCommit

- Grant CodeCommit full access only to administrators.
- Assign the PowerUser policy for developers.
- Provide read-only access to third parties.
- Create custom policies to prevent direct pushes to the main/master branch.

### S3 Bucket Policies and AWS Config

- Use S3 bucket policies to enforce HTTPS requests. AWS Config rules can verify that S3 buckets require SSL.
- To comply with AWS Config rules, your S3 buckets must have a policy that explicitly denies HTTP requests and allows only HTTPS. Use a "Deny" effect with a condition that checks if `aws:SecureTransport` is `false`.

### Secrets Manager vs. SSM Parameter Store

- SSM Parameter Store is free and suitable for storing configuration data and secrets. It does not support automatic secret rotation.
- Secrets Manager is a paid service offering additional features like secret rotation, cross-account access, and automated password generation. It's ideal for managing database credentials and other secrets that require rotation.

### AWS Managed Policies

### AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

- Provides a centralized platform for managing EC2 instances and on-premises machines configured with the SSM Agent.

### System Manager Inventory

- Collects metadata from your managed instances, including information on installed applications, OS versions, network configurations, and more.
- Useful for assessing on-premises instances for migration to AWS by ensuring that new AWS instances match the configuration of current on-premises environments.

### Patch Manager

- Allows defining custom patch baselines for software updates.
- Schedule patch application through maintenance windows for automated updates.

### AWS Config

- Audits and records compliance of AWS resources.
- Records configurations and changes over time.
- Alerts for configuration changes.
- Is a per-region service but can aggregate data across accounts and regions.
- Configuration data can be saved to S3 and queried with Amazon Athena.
- Integrates with AWS CloudTrail for detailed API tracking.
- Automates remediation of non-compliant resources using SSM Automation Documents.

### AWS Organizations

- Facilitates central governance of AWS accounts and resources.
- Automatically creates an `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM Role in member accounts for administrative tasks.

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)

- Define IAM action allowlists or blocklists.
- Apply at the OU or account level, excluding the management account.
- Do not affect service-linked roles but apply to all users and roles, including root.
- SCPs require explicit allow statements; by default, they do not grant permissions.

### AWS Control Tower

- Simplifies the setup and governance of a secure, compliant multi-account AWS environment.
- Automates account provisioning and policy management.
- Based on AWS Organizations, it enables pre-approved baseline configurations for AWS accounts using AWS Service Catalog.
- Features Guardrails for ongoing governance, including preventive measures via SCPs and detective measures using AWS Config.

### AWS Control Tower and AWS Config Integration

- Uses AWS Config for implementing detective guardrails.
- Automates enabling of AWS Config in all regions.
- Centralizes AWS Config data in a dedicated log archive account.

### AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)

- Facilitates provisioning and customizing AWS accounts through Terraform.
- Utilizes a Terraform file for

 account requests, triggering an AFT workflow for account creation and customization.

### IAM Identity Center and Single Sign-On

- Provides a single login portal for all AWS accounts within an organization.
- Supports integration with external identity providers (IdPs) including built-in identity stores, Active Directory, and others.
- Enables fine-grained permissions and multi-account access through permission sets and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- Protects web applications from common web exploits.
- Can be deployed on Application Load Balancers, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon CloudFront, and AWS AppSync.
- Offers a library of managed rules for protection against SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other threats.

### AWS Firewall Manager

- Centralizes management of security rules across AWS accounts in an organization, including WAF rules and security groups.

### Amazon GuardDuty

- Provides intelligent threat detection for AWS accounts using machine learning.
- Easy to enable with a one-click 30-day trial.
- Analyzes data from AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs for comprehensive security monitoring.
