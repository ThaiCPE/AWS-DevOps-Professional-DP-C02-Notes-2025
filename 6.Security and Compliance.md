## Management and Governance on AWS

AWS provides a robust suite of management and governance services to streamline provisioning, management, governance, and operation of cloud environments. These services—**AWS Organizations**, **AWS Config**, **AWS Service Catalog**, and **AWS Systems Manager**—enforce operational standards and ensure compliance with corporate IT policies.

- **AWS Organizations**: Centralizes governance across AWS accounts and resources, enabling policy-based management for multiple accounts.
- **AWS Service Catalog**: Enables organizations to create and manage catalogs of approved IT services, such as virtual machine images, servers, software, and multi-tier application architectures.
- **AWS Systems Manager**: Offers a unified interface for managing AWS and on-premises infrastructure, with features like system patching, session management, automation, and parameter management.
- **AWS Config**: Automates compliance assessments by tracking resource configurations against internal policies and regulatory standards.

## Security Services

### AWS Inspector
- An automated security assessment service that identifies vulnerabilities and enforces security standards in your AWS environment.
- Install the AWS Inspector agent via Systems Manager to run assessments on EC2 instances.

### Amazon GuardDuty
- Enhances security with intelligent, machine learning-driven threat detection across AWS accounts.
- Analyzes data from AWS CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs to identify threats like intra-VPC port scanning, cryptocurrency mining, and malware.

### Amazon Macie
- Supports compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR by detecting personally identifiable information (PII) in Amazon S3 buckets.

### AWS Trusted Advisor
- Delivers real-time recommendations for optimizing costs, enhancing security, improving fault tolerance, managing service limits, and boosting performance.

## Best Practices for AWS CodeBuild

- Define build commands and settings using a **buildspec file**.
- Avoid hardcoding passwords; use IAM policies and roles for permissions.
- Store sensitive data in **AWS SSM Parameter Store** or **AWS Secrets Manager**.
- Execute commands securely with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) instead of SSH.

---

## Best Practices for AWS CodeCommit

- Limit **CodeCommitFullAccess** to administrators.
- Assign the **PowerUser** policy to developers.
- Grant **ReadOnly** access to third parties.
- Implement custom policies to block direct pushes to the `main` or `master` branch.

---

## S3 Bucket Policies and AWS Config

- Enforce HTTPS requests using S3 bucket policies.
- Use AWS Config rules to verify that S3 buckets require SSL.
- Ensure compliance by applying a policy with a `"Deny"` effect for HTTP requests (e.g., `"aws:SecureTransport": "false"`).

---

## Secrets Manager vs. SSM Parameter Store

- **SSM Parameter Store**: Free service for storing configuration data and secrets, without automatic rotation.
- **Secrets Manager**: Paid service offering automatic secret rotation, cross-account access, and password generation—ideal for database credentials.

---

## AWS Managed Policies

AWS simplifies permission management with predefined policies:
- **AdministratorAccess**: Full access to all AWS services.
- **PowerUserAccess**: Broad access excluding IAM management.
- **ReadOnlyAccess**: View-only permissions.

---

## AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

- Centralizes management of EC2 instances and on-premises machines via the SSM Agent.
- Key capabilities include patching, session management, automation, and parameter storage.

### System Manager Inventory
- Collects metadata (e.g., installed applications, OS versions) from managed instances.
- Assists in assessing on-premises systems for AWS migration.

### Patch Manager
- Defines custom patch baselines and schedules updates using maintenance windows.

---

## AWS Config

- Audits and tracks AWS resource compliance.
- Records configurations and changes over time, sending alerts for updates.
- Operates per-region but can aggregate data across accounts and regions.
- Stores configuration data in S3 for querying with Amazon Athena.
- Integrates with AWS CloudTrail for API tracking and uses SSM Automation Documents for remediation.

---

## AWS Organizations

- Centralizes governance of AWS accounts and resources.
- Creates an `OrganizationAccountAccessRole` IAM role in member accounts for administrative tasks.

### Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- Define allowlists or blocklists for IAM actions at the OU or account level (excluding the management account).
- Apply to all users and roles (including root) but not service-linked roles.
- Require explicit allows; permissions are denied by default.

---

## AWS Control Tower

- Simplifies setup and governance of secure, compliant multi-account AWS environments.
- Automates account provisioning and policy enforcement using AWS Organizations and AWS Service Catalog for pre-approved baselines.
- Features **Guardrails**:
  - **Preventive**: Enforced via SCPs.
  - **Detective**: Monitored using AWS Config.

### AWS Control Tower and AWS Config Integration
- Leverages AWS Config for detective guardrails.
- Automatically enables AWS Config across all regions.
- Centralizes configuration data in a log archive account.

### AWS Control Tower Account Factory for Terraform (AFT)
- Provisions and customizes AWS accounts using Terraform.
- Triggers an AFT workflow via a Terraform file for account creation.

---

## IAM Identity Center and Single Sign-On

- Provides a single login portal for all AWS accounts in an organization.
- Integrates with external identity providers (e.g., Active Directory) and supports fine-grained permissions via permission sets and attribute-based access control (ABAC).

---

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- Protects web applications from exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
- Deployable on Application Load Balancers, API Gateway, CloudFront, and AppSync, with managed rule sets.

---

## AWS Firewall Manager

- Centralizes management of security rules (e.g., WAF, security groups) across AWS accounts in an organization.

---

## Amazon GuardDuty

- Offers intelligent threat detection using machine learning.
- Analyzes CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS logs for comprehensive monitoring.
- Simple to enable with a one-click 30-day trial.
