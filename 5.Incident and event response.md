## AWS EventBridge

AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus that enables you to automate your AWS services and application workflow by reacting to changes in AWS resources. It routes events from AWS services, custom applications, and SaaS partner services to targets like AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and more for processing. While AWS CloudWatch Events and Amazon EventBridge share the same API and underlying service, EventBridge offers additional features and a broader set of integrations.

## Amazon S3 Event Notifications

Amazon S3 Event Notifications alert you to specific events in your S3 buckets, such as:

- Object creation (PUT, POST, COPY, and multipart upload completion)
- Object deletion
- Object restoration from Amazon S3 Glacier
- Loss of object redundancy
- Objects becoming eligible for replication with Amazon S3 Replication Time Control (RTC)

## Amazon RDS Event Notifications

Amazon RDS provides notifications for various database events through Amazon SNS. These notifications can alert you to important RDS DB instance events, including:

- Creation, modification, restart, or deletion of a DB instance
- Low storage
- Configuration changes
- Multi-AZ failover events

## Handling AWS Risk of Exposed Credentials

AWS Step Functions can orchestrate the components of operational response automation with a visual workflow, which can be integrated with EventBridge or CloudWatch rules. This enables automated remediation actions, such as revoking exposed AWS credentials (e.g., ACCESS KEY, Secret, and password) pushed inadvertently by a development team member.

### Orchestrating Events in AWS CodePipeline

In AWS CodePipeline, the `runOrder` and `pollForSourceChanges` parameters help orchestrate various activities. By utilizing different Lambda functions and specifying `runOrder` values, along with the `pollForSourceChanges` parameter, you can automate pipeline execution based on source changes from AWS CodeCommit, Amazon S3, or GitHub repositories.

## AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) enables you to collect metrics, traces, and contextual data from your applications and services. This data can be sent to AWS monitoring services such as Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray for analysis and observability, facilitating better understanding and debugging of distributed applications.
