## AWS EventBridge

AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus that automates workflows by reacting to changes in AWS resources, routing events from AWS services, custom applications, and SaaS partner services to targets like AWS Lambda, Amazon SNS, Amazon SQS, and more for processing. While it shares the same underlying API as AWS CloudWatch Events, EventBridge extends functionality with broader integrations and advanced features.

### Key Features
- Integrates with over 200 AWS services and 35+ SaaS partners.
- Supports event schemas for standardized event processing.

### 2025 Enhancements
- **AI-Driven Event Pattern Matching**: Leverages Amazon Q to accelerate rule creation with intelligent pattern recognition.
- **Multi-Region Event Routing**: Enables efficient event distribution across regions, with sustainability-aware target selection to minimize environmental impact.

## Amazon S3 Event Notifications

Amazon S3 Event Notifications provide alerts for specific activities within S3 buckets, enabling automated responses to events such as:

- **Object Creation**: Triggered by PUT, POST, COPY, or multipart upload completion.
- **Object Deletion**: Includes permanent or versioned removals.
- **Object Restoration**: From Amazon S3 Glacier or Deep Archive.
- **Loss of Object Redundancy**: Alerts for reduced durability events.
- **Replication Eligibility**: Triggers for objects meeting Amazon S3 Replication Time Control (RTC) criteria.

### 2025 Updates
- **Tag-Based Event Filtering**: Filter notifications using object tags for improved compliance and cost management.
- **EventBridge Integration**: Expands routing capabilities beyond traditional targets like SNS or Lambda.

## Amazon RDS Event Notifications

Amazon RDS delivers notifications via Amazon SNS for key database events, keeping you informed about your RDS DB instances. Supported events include:

- **Instance Lifecycle**: Creation, modification, restart, or deletion.
- **Resource Alerts**: Low storage thresholds.
- **Configuration Updates**: Changes to instance settings.
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ failover events.

### 2025 Enhancements
- **Real-Time Failover Alerts**: Includes AWS X-Ray tracing for rapid root cause analysis during failovers.
- **Multi-Region Aggregation**: Consolidates event data across regions using EventBridge.

## Handling AWS Risk of Exposed Credentials

AWS Step Functions, when combined with EventBridge or CloudWatch rules, orchestrates automated remediation workflows with a visual interface. This is particularly useful for addressing security incidents, such as revoking exposed AWS credentials (e.g., ACCESS KEY, Secret, or password) accidentally committed by developers.

### Workflow Example
1. EventBridge detects credential exposure in a CodeCommit push.
2. Step Functions triggers a Lambda function to disable the exposed keys.
3. An SNS notification alerts the security team.

### 2025 Features
- **AI-Powered Detection**: Identifies credential patterns in logs using machine learning.
- **Zero-Trust Enforcement**: Automatically updates access policies to require MFA after detection.

## Orchestrating Events in AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline leverages parameters like `runOrder` and `pollForSourceChanges` to manage event-driven automation:

- **`runOrder`**: Defines the sequence of actions (e.g., Lambda invocations) within pipeline stages.
- **`pollForSourceChanges`**: Controls polling for updates from sources like AWS CodeCommit, Amazon S3, or GitHub.

### Usage
- Automates pipeline execution based on source changes, with Lambda functions customizing the workflow.

### 2025 Updates
- **EventBridge Integration**: Replaces polling with real-time event triggers for source changes.
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Tracks pipeline efficiency to support eco-friendly DevOps practices.

## AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT)

AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) collects metrics, traces, and contextual data from applications and services, sending them to AWS monitoring tools like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray, or third-party observability platforms. This enhances debugging and understanding of distributed systems.

### Benefits
- Simplifies instrumentation across multiple programming languages.
- Provides comprehensive observability for complex architectures.

### 2025 Enhancements
- **Enhanced Trace Sampling**: Optimizes data collection for cost efficiency.
- **CloudWatch Synthetics Integration**: Enables end-to-end monitoring of application performance.
