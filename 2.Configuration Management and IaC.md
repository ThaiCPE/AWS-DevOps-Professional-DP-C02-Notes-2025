# Configuration Management

Configuration management is like maintaining a comprehensive, up-to-date manual for setting up and managing every component of a computer system—software, hardware, and networking. In 2025, AWS emphasizes automation and consistency in configuration management to support resilient, scalable cloud environments.

### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Enables systems to grow seamlessly with automated configurations.
- **Reliability**: Ensures consistent setups, reducing errors across environments.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Simplifies restoration with predefined, reproducible configurations.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- **Observability**: Integration with CloudWatch and X-Ray for real-time configuration monitoring.
- **Compliance**: Automated checks via AWS Config align with zero-trust security models.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

IaC takes configuration management to the next level by managing and provisioning data centers through machine-readable files rather than manual processes or interactive tools. In 2025, AWS doubles down on IaC as a foundational DevOps practice, emphasizing safety, scalability, and multi-account governance.

### Benefits
- **Human-readable Configurations**: Simplifies understanding and collaboration.
- **Ability to Preview Changes**: Previews infrastructure updates before deployment.
- **Extensibility for Future Growth**: Adapts to evolving needs with modular designs.
- **Management Across Accounts and Regions**: Streamlines multi-region and multi-account setups.
- **Dependency Management**: Handles software and resource dependencies efficiently.
- **Enhanced Safety Controls**: Integrates guardrails and compliance checks.

#### 2025 Focus
- **Sustainability**: Optimizes resource provisioning to reduce waste, per AWS’s sustainability goals.
- **AI Assistance**: Tools like Amazon Q suggest IaC optimizations.

# AWS CloudFormation

CloudFormation offers a declarative approach to define AWS infrastructure, enabling automation, version control, and reviewable changes. In 2025, it remains a core IaC tool, with enhancements for security and multi-region deployments.

### Capabilities
- **Automate Resource Creation**: Eliminates manual setup with reusable templates.
- **Version Control**: Tracks infrastructure changes via Git integration.
- **Review Changes**: Validates updates through code diffs and drift detection.

### CloudFormation Building Blocks
- **Resources**: Core AWS components (e.g., EC2, S3) defined in templates.
- **Parameters**: Customizable inputs for flexibility across environments.
- **Mappings**: Static variables for environment-specific configurations.
- **Outputs**: Values exported for cross-stack use or console visibility.
- **Conditions**: Logic to control resource provisioning dynamically.
- **Metadata**: Additional template details, now with sustainability annotations in 2025.

### Template Helpers
1. **Helper Functions**: Enhance functionality (e.g., `Fn::Ref`, `Fn::Join`, `Fn::Sub`).
2. **YAML Tips**: Preferred for readability, comments, and support for nested structures.

### Important Concepts
- **Pseudo Parameters**: Default AWS values (e.g., `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::Region`).
- **Intrinsic Functions**: Operations like `Fn::GetAtt` for attribute retrieval and `Fn::If` for logic.
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies out-of-band changes, with 2025 UI improvements.
- **Deletion Policies**: Options like `Retain`, `Snapshot` for resource retention.
- **Custom Resources**: Lambda-backed logic for non-native AWS resources.
- **Service Roles**: IAM roles for CloudFormation to manage resources securely.
- **StackSets**: Multi-account, multi-region stack management, enhanced with drift reporting in 2025.

### Deployment Strategies
- **AutoScalingReplacingUpdate**: Replaces scaling groups for major updates.
- **AutoScalingRollingUpdate**: Updates instances in batches, minimizing downtime.

#### 2025 Updates
- **Change Sets**: Enhanced previews with cost and sustainability impact analysis.
- **Guardrails**: AWS Config Rules integration for compliance enforcement.

### Service Catalog
Manages a curated set of CloudFormation templates, streamlining governance. In 2025, it integrates with AWS Organizations for centralized policy enforcement across accounts.

### Elastic Beanstalk
A high-level service for deploying applications on EC2, ASG, ELB, and RDS. It supports diverse deployment models (e.g., web server, worker) with 2025 enhancements for containerized workloads.

#### 2025 Features
- **ECS Integration**: Simplified container deployments via EB CLI.
- **X-Ray Support**: Enhanced tracing for configuration troubleshooting.

### AWS CDK and SAM
- **AWS CDK**: Defines IaC in languages like TypeScript or Python, with 2025 updates for sustainability-focused constructs.
- **AWS SAM**: Focuses on serverless, now with improved local testing via SAM CLI v2.

### AWS Step Functions
Orchestrates workflows as state machines, with 2025 enhancements for nested workflows and tighter integration with EventBridge for event-driven IaC updates.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- **Express Workflows**: Optimized for high-volume, short-duration tasks.
- **Visualization**: Improved console for workflow debugging.

### AWS AppConfig and Systems Manager
- **AppConfig**: Deploys dynamic configurations independently of code, with 2025 canary rollout support.
- **Systems Manager**: Centralizes operational data and automation, enhanced with Parameter Store encryption via customer-managed KMS keys.

#### 2025 Features
- **Automation Runbooks**: Prebuilt workflows for configuration remediation.
- **Compliance Checks**: Real-time validation against AWS Config rules.

# OpsWorks

AWS OpsWorks provides managed Chef and Puppet instances, supporting auto-scaling and lifecycle management. In 2025, it emphasizes hybrid cloud compatibility and auto-healing.

### Key Features
- **Auto-Scaling**: Time- or load-based scaling with ECS/Fargate support.
- **Lifecycle Events**: Setup, configure, deploy, undeploy, and shutdown hooks.
- **Auto-Healing**: Replaces failed instances automatically.

### Key Concepts to Remember
- **Application Discovery**: AWS Application Discovery Service assesses on-premises VMs for migration, with 2025 AI-driven recommendations.
- **OpsWorks Lifecycle Hooks**: Custom scripts for instance management tasks.
- **Service Roles and Permissions**: IAM roles updated for least-privilege access in 2025.

#### 2025 Updates
- **Hybrid Support**: Improved integration with AWS Outposts for on-premises IaC.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics for OpsWorks stack performance.
