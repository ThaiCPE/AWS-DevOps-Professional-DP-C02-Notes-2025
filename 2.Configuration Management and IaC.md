# Configuration Management

Configuration management is akin to maintaining a detailed instruction manual for setting up and managing every component of a computer system, including software, hardware, and networking.

### Benefits

- Scalability
- Reliability
- Disaster Recovery

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) elevates the concept of configuration management. It is a method where computer data centers are managed and set up through machine-readable files, rather than through manual configuration processes or interactive configuration tools.

### Benefits

- Human-readable configurations
- Ability to preview changes to your environment
- Extensibility for future growth
- Management across accounts and regions
- Dependency management for software components
- Enhanced safety controls

# AWS CloudFormation

CloudFormation provides a declarative way to outline your AWS infrastructure, allowing you to:

- Automate resource creation, eliminating manual processes
- Utilize version control for infrastructure code
- Review infrastructure changes through code

### CloudFormation Building Blocks

- **Resources**: Core elements of your template, representing AWS components to be created and configured.
- **Parameters**: Inputs to your template for customization.
- **Mappings**: Fixed variables within your template for different environments or configurations.
- **Outputs**: Optional values that can be used in other stacks or viewed in the AWS console.
- **Conditions**: Logical statements that control resource creation.
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the template or its elements.

### Template Helpers

1. **Helper Functions**: Enhance template functionality, like referencing resources or performing operations on strings.
2. **YAML Tips**: Prefer YAML over JSON for readability and support for comments, nested objects, arrays, and multi-line strings.

### Important Concepts

- **Pseudo Parameters**: AWS-specific parameters available by default (e.g., `AccountId`, `Region`).
- **Intrinsic Functions**: Built-in functions for operations like referencing resources (`Fn::Ref`), retrieving attribute values (`Fn::GetAtt`), and more.
- **Drift Detection**: Identifies manual changes to infrastructure that aren't reflected in the CloudFormation template.
- **Deletion Policies**: Control how resources are handled upon stack deletion (e.g., `Retain`, `Snapshot`).
- **Custom Resources**: Extend CloudFormation with custom logic for resource provisioning.
- **Service Roles**: IAM roles that allow CloudFormation to manage resources on your behalf.
- **StackSets**: Manage stacks across multiple accounts and regions with a single operation.

### Deployment Strategies

- **AutoScalingReplacingUpdate** vs. **AutoScalingRollingUpdate**: Choose between creating a new scaling group or updating instances in batches for deployment strategies.

### Service Catalog

- Offers a way to manage a collection of CloudFormation templates and products, streamlining governance and access for users.

### Elastic Beanstalk

A high-level AWS service for deploying applications using underlying services like EC2, ASG, ELB, and RDS. It supports various deployment models and platforms, catering to different operational models (e.g., web server vs. worker environments).

### AWS CDK and SAM

- The Cloud Development Kit (CDK) allows defining cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages.
- The Serverless Application Model (SAM) focuses on serverless deployments.

### AWS Step Functions

Orchestrates complex workflows as state machines, providing visualizations and execution controls.

### AWS AppConfig and System Manager

- AppConfig supports dynamic configuration deployments independent of code deployments.
- System Manager centralizes operational data and automates tasks across AWS resources.

# OpsWorks

AWS OpsWorks provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. It supports auto-scaling based on time or load, integrating lifecycle events like setup, configuration, deployment, and shutdown with auto-healing capabilities.

### Key Concepts to Remember

- **Application Discovery**: Tools for assessing on-premises VMs for migration to AWS.
- **OpsWorks Lifecycle Hooks**: Customize management tasks for instances within a stack.
- **Service Roles and Permissions**: Ensure proper IAM setup for resource management and operations.
