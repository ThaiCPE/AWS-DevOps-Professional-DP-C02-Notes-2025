# AWS Config

AWS Config enables monitoring, auditing, and evaluation of your AWS resources. It allows tracking and reviewing configuration changes of your resources and assessing compliance against internal IT policies.

### Limitations

1. Only monitors in regions where it's enabled within your AWS account.

AWS Config supports multi-region, multi-account capabilities through the creation of an aggregator to collect data from specified regions.

### Aggregators

An Aggregator in AWS Config collects or groups data across regions or accounts for centralized monitoring.

### VPC Flow Logs Limitations

VPC Flow Logs do not capture all IP traffic. Exclusions include:

- Traffic to/from the instance metadata and Amazon Time Sync Service.
- DHCP traffic.
- Traffic to the reserved IP addresses for the default VPC router.
- Traffic between ELBs (Elastic Load Balancers) and ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces).
- License activation traffic for Amazon EC2 Windows instances.
- Traffic generated by instances connecting to Amazon DNS servers.

Note: Traffic to a self-managed BIND DNS server is logged by VPC Flow Logs.

# CloudTrail

CloudTrail is pivotal for auditing, capturing API calls and related events. It can track events across all AWS accounts in an organization.

### Integrity of CloudTrail Log Files

Enable log file validation to ensure the integrity and veracity of CloudTrail log files.

# CloudWatch

CloudWatch allows real-time access to log events via log subscriptions, delivering data to services like Kinesis streams, Kinesis Firehose, or Lambda.

### CloudWatch Metric Streams

### CloudWatch Custom Metrics

- Custom metrics can be defined and sent to CloudWatch using the `PutMetricData` API call.

### CloudWatch Anomaly Detection

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze metrics continuously, establishing normal baselines and highlighting anomalies.

### Amazon Lookout for Metrics

- Detects anomalies within metrics automatically, identifying root causes with machine learning.
- Requires no manual setup and integrates with AWS Services and third-party SaaS applications via AppFlow.
- Supports alerts to SNS, Lambda, Slack, and Webhooks.

### CloudWatch Logs

- Organized into log groups and log streams.
- Supports log expiration policies.

### CloudWatch Logs Insights

- Provides a query engine to search and analyze log data stored in CloudWatch.

### CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries

- Scripts can be configured to monitor APIs, URLs, and websites, mimicking user interactions.
- Measures availability, latency, and captures load time data and UI screenshots.

### Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

# AWS Trusted Advisor

AWS Trusted Advisor offers real-time guidance to provision resources according to AWS best practices in:

- Cost optimization
- Performance
- Security
- Fault tolerance
- Service limits

### Service Limits Monitoring

Understand and monitor AWS service limits to avoid hitting them, especially when creating auto-scaling groups. AWS Trusted Advisor and CloudWatch Alarms can track these limits. Note: The `ServiceLimitUsage` metric in CloudWatch is only visible to accounts with Business or Enterprise support plans.
