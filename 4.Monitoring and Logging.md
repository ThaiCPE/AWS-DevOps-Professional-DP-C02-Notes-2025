# AWS Config

AWS Config tracks, audits, and evaluates AWS resource configurations, ensuring compliance with internal IT policies. In 2025, itâ€™s a key tool for continuous monitoring and governance.

### Capabilities
- Monitors resource configuration changes over time.
- Assesses compliance against predefined rules.

### Limitations
- Only monitors regions where enabled in your account.

#### Multi-Region/Multi-Account
- Use **Aggregators** to centralize data collection across regions and accounts.

### Aggregators
Aggregators consolidate configuration and compliance data from multiple sources for unified analysis.

#### 2025 Updates
- Enhanced aggregators support real-time compliance dashboards with sustainability metrics.

### VPC Flow Logs Limitations
VPC Flow Logs capture IP traffic with exceptions:
- Traffic to/from instance metadata and Amazon Time Sync Service.
- DHCP traffic.
- Traffic to default VPC router reserved IPs.
- Traffic between ELBs and ENIs.
- Windows license activation traffic.
- Traffic to Amazon DNS servers (self-managed BIND DNS traffic is logged).

#### 2025 Notes
- New exclusion filters for custom DNS traffic analysis.

# CloudTrail

CloudTrail is essential for auditing, logging API calls and events across AWS accounts, especially within an organization.

### Features
- Captures management, data, and network events.
- Supports organization-wide tracking via AWS Organizations.

### Integrity of CloudTrail Log Files
- Enable **log file validation** to verify file integrity using cryptographic hashes.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- Integration with EventBridge for real-time event routing.
- AI-driven anomaly detection in log patterns via CloudWatch.

# CloudWatch

CloudWatch provides real-time monitoring of logs, metrics, and events, delivering data to Kinesis, Firehose, or Lambda via subscriptions.

### CloudWatch Metric Streams
- Streams metric data to destinations like S3 or third-party tools for analysis.

#### 2025 Features
- Sustainability-focused streaming with optimized data compression.

### CloudWatch Custom Metrics
- Use `PutMetricData` API to send user-defined metrics to CloudWatch.

#### 2025 Updates
- Granularity down to 1-second intervals for high-precision monitoring.

### CloudWatch Anomaly Detection
- Applies ML to establish metric baselines and flag deviations.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- Improved ML models with Amazon Q integration for predictive alerts.

### Amazon Lookout for Metrics
- Automatically detects metric anomalies using ML, identifying root causes.
- Integrates with AWS services and SaaS apps via AppFlow.
- Supports alerts to SNS, Lambda, Slack, and Webhooks.

#### 2025 Updates
- Enhanced root cause analysis with X-Ray correlation.

### CloudWatch Logs
- Organized into **log groups** (categories) and **log streams** (event sequences).
- Configurable expiration policies for cost management.

#### 2025 Features
- Auto-tagging logs for compliance and sustainability tracking.

### CloudWatch Logs Insights
- Query engine for searching and analyzing log data.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- AI-assisted query suggestions via Amazon Q.

### CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries
- Scripts monitor APIs, URLs, and websites, simulating user actions.
- Measures availability, latency, and captures UI data (e.g., screenshots).

#### 2025 Updates
- Canary scripts now support multi-region testing with latency optimization.

### Amazon Athena
- Interactive SQL query service for analyzing S3 data.

#### 2025 Features
- Federated queries enhanced for multi-region S3 buckets.
- Cost-efficient query execution with sustainability-aware partitioning.

# AWS Trusted Advisor

Trusted Advisor provides real-time recommendations based on AWS best practices for:
- **Cost Optimization**: Identifies savings opportunities.
- **Performance**: Suggests efficiency improvements.
- **Security**: Highlights vulnerabilities.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Enhances resilience.
- **Service Limits**: Monitors usage thresholds.

### Service Limits Monitoring
- Tracks AWS service quotas to prevent scaling issues.
- Uses CloudWatch Alarms and Trusted Advisor for alerts.
- **ServiceLimitUsage** metric requires Business/Enterprise support plans.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- AI-driven limit predictions with proactive scaling recommendations.
- Sustainability checks for resource over-provisioning.
