## HA vs Fault Tolerance

**HA (High Availability)** ensures that the service continues running with minimal downtime.

**Fault Tolerance** is about designing systems that continue to operate without loss of functionality, even when parts of it fail.

### Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region

**Multi-AZ** provides backup within the same region but in different locations to handle failures with minimal noticeable downtime.

**Multi-Region** spreads your application across different geographical areas to ensure it stays up during major events or disasters and to reduce latency for users worldwide.

### RTO and RPO

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** - The time it takes after a disruption to restore a business process to its service level.

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** - The maximum amount of data loss measured in time that a business can endure.

### Route 53 Routing Policies

- **Simple** - For a single resource performing a straightforward function.
- **Failover** - For active-passive failover configurations.
- **Geolocation** - Routes traffic based on the geographical location of the requester.
- **Geoproximity** - Routes traffic based on the geographic location of your users and resources.
- **Latency** - Routes users to the server location that provides the fastest response time.
- **Multivalue Answer** - Routes traffic to multiple resources, selecting up to eight active records randomly.
- **Weighted** - Distributes traffic across multiple resources based on defined weights.

### Autoscaling Lifecycle Hooks

- **Pending:Wait** & **Pending:Proceed**
- **Terminating:Wait** & **Terminating:Proceed**

During the paused state, you can perform custom actions, receive scaling actions via Amazon EventBridge or CloudWatch Events, invoke Lambda functions, send notifications using SNS, or trigger SSM Run Command or Automation tasks.

### Karpenter

Karpenter is an open-source project by AWS designed to handle node provisioning on Kubernetes clusters.

### Amazon EKS Networking

Deploying an EKS Cluster creates two VPCs; one hosts the Kubernetes control plane, which is not visible to the user. AWS creates EKS-managed ENIs (Elastic Network Interfaces) for internal communication within the VPC.

### EKS Networking Add-ons

- **Amazon VPC CNI** - Provides networking for pods, assigning a private IP address to each.
- **AWS Load Balancer Controller** - For high availability, it uses Amazon Application Load Balancers to distribute traffic.
- **CoreDNS** - Provides name resolution for all pods in the cluster.
- **Kube-proxy** - Maintains network rules on nodes to allow communication within and outside of the cluster.
- **Calico** - For network segmentation and tenant isolation in multi-tenant environments or to separate environments like development, staging, and production.

### Amazon Lookout for Metrics

Uses machine learning to continuously monitor data for anomalies, identifying root causes and triggering actions accordingly.

### Amazon S3 Object Tagging and Access Control

Object tags help identify resources and control access. For instance, using tags, you can restrict access to objects in an S3 bucket based on their DataClassification or Owner.

### Amazon Storage Gateway

- **Amazon S3 File Gateway**
- **Amazon FSx File Gateway**
- **Tape Gateway**
- **Volume Gateway**

### Amazon CodeGuru

Uses machine learning for automated code reviews, identifying potential defects or bugs.

### AWS Lambda Versions

- Work in progress uses `$Latest`.
- Publish a version when ready; versions are immutable.
- Aliases are mutable and act as pointers to Lambda function versions, supporting canary deployments by assigning weights.
- Aliases have their own ARNs and cannot be referred to directly.

### Lambda Concurrency

- The concurrency limit is up to 1000 executions.
- Reserved concurrency limits trigger throttling.
- Synchronous invocations return HTTP 429 upon throttling; asynchronous ones go to the dead letter queue.

### API Gateway

**Endpoint Types:**
- **Edge Optimized** (default)
- **Regional**

### Security and Deployment Stages

- Supports user authentication and HTTPS for custom domain names.
- Stage variables act like environment variables, allowing configuration changes without code modifications.

### ECS and EKS Logging

- **ECS**: Use the `awslogs` log driver or a sidecar container for log collection.
- **EKS**: Control plane logs are sent to CloudWatch. Node, pod, and container logs require third-party tools like CloudWatch agent, Fluent Bit, or Fluentd.

### Kinesis

Kinesis facilitates real-time data collection, processing, and analysis. It supports applications logs, metrics, clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data through various services like Kinesis Data Streams, Data Firehose, Data Analytics, and Video Streams.

### Disaster Recovery Strategies

- **Backup and Restore**
- **Pilot Light**: A small version of the app runs continuously in the cloud.
- **Warm Standby**: The full system runs at minimum size, scalable to production load upon disaster.
- **Multi-Site/Hot Site**: Runs full production scale concurrently on AWS and on-premises; expensive but provides very low RTO.

### Backup, High Availability, Replication, and Automation

- **Backup**: Use EBS snapshots, RDS automated backups, and regular pushes to S3.
- **High Availability (HA)**: Leverage services like Route 53, RDS Multi-AZ, and site-to-site VPN.
- **Replication**: Consider RDS replication, database replication, and Storage Gateway for data consistency across sites.
- **Automation**: Implement solutions using CloudFormation, EC2 recovery, and Lambda functions for resilient infrastructure.

### Chaos Engineering

Netflix's Simian Army is an example of intentionally introducing failures to test system resilience, including randomly terminating EC2 instances to ensure that systems can withstand real-world issues.
