## HA vs Fault Tolerance

- **HA (High Availability)**: Ensures services run with minimal downtime, focusing on uptime continuity.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Designs systems to operate fully despite component failures, prioritizing zero functionality loss.

#### 2025 Context
- HA leverages multi-AZ and multi-region setups, while fault tolerance integrates AI-driven self-healing (e.g., via Lambda triggers).

## Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region

- **Multi-AZ**: Deploys backups within a region across isolated zones, minimizing downtime during local failures.
- **Multi-Region**: Spans applications across geographic regions for disaster resilience and latency optimization.

#### 2025 Enhancements
- Multi-region strategies now emphasize sustainability with region-specific carbon footprint metrics in AWS tools.

## RTO and RPO

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Time to restore a process to its service level post-disruption.
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Maximum acceptable data loss, measured in time, during a failure.

#### 2025 Focus
- Exam scenarios test RTO/RPO optimization with services like RDS Multi-AZ and S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR).

## Route 53 Routing Policies

- **Simple**: Directs traffic to a single resource for basic use cases.
- **Failover**: Supports active-passive setups for resilience.
- **Geolocation**: Routes based on user location for compliance or customization.
- **Geoproximity**: Directs traffic by proximity to users/resources, adjustable with bias settings.
- **Latency**: Sends users to the lowest-latency endpoint.
- **Multivalue Answer**: Returns up to eight healthy records randomly for load distribution.
- **Weighted**: Allocates traffic by weight for A/B testing or phased rollouts.

#### 2025 Updates
- Enhanced health checks with CloudWatch Synthetics for all policies.
- Sustainability-aware routing prioritizes low-carbon regions.

## Autoscaling Lifecycle Hooks

- **Pending:Wait** & **Pending:Proceed**: Pauses instance launch for custom actions.
- **Terminating:Wait** & **Terminating:Proceed**: Pauses termination for cleanup tasks.

#### Usage

#### 2025 Enhancements
- AI-driven scaling triggers via Amazon Q suggestions in CloudWatch.

## Amazon Storage Gateway

- **S3 File Gateway**: Links on-premises apps to S3.
- **FSx File Gateway**: Accesses FSx file shares from on-premises.
- **Tape Gateway**: Replaces physical tapes with S3-backed virtual tapes.

#### Notes
- Aliases have unique ARNs but can’t be directly invoked.

#### 2025 Updates
- Alias traffic shifting now includes pre/post hooks for validation.

## Lambda Concurrency

- **Limit**: 1000 concurrent executions (adjustable).
- **Reserved Concurrency**: Caps execution, triggering throttling if exceeded.
- **Behavior**: Synchronous calls return HTTP 429; async calls route to DLQ.

- Stage variables act as environment configs, avoiding code changes.

#### 2025 Updates
- Zero-trust security with mandatory MFA for admin access.

## ECS and EKS Logging

- **ECS**: Uses `awslogs` driver or sidecar containers for logs.
- **EKS**: Control plane logs go to CloudWatch; node/pod logs need Fluent Bit or Fluentd.
